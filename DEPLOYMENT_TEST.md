# Deployment Test

This file is created to test the CI/CD pipeline deployment to EC2.

## Test Status
- âœ… EC2 server set up
- âœ… Repository cloned to /var/www/bazary-dev
- âœ… Environment file configured
- âœ… Containers running successfully
- âœ… GitHub secrets configured
- âœ… Debug toolbar and static files fixed
- âœ… Health endpoint working locally
- ðŸ”„ Final CI/CD pipeline validation

## Local Deployment Success âœ…
The application is now running successfully on EC2:
- âœ… Database migrations: Applied successfully
- âœ… Health endpoint: Working (200 OK response)
- âœ… External access: Accessible via EC2 public IP
- âœ… All containers: Running and healthy

## Expected Behavior
When this file is committed and pushed to the develop branch, it should trigger:
1. âœ… Code quality checks (Black, isort)
2. âœ… Unit tests
3. âœ… Integration tests 
4. âœ… API tests
5. âœ… Docker image build
6. âœ… Deployment to EC2 development server

## Final Validation Test
This commit serves as the final validation of the complete CI/CD pipeline:
- **Automated Testing**: All test suites should pass
- **Code Quality**: Black and isort formatting compliance
- **Container Build**: Docker images build successfully
- **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to EC2 development server
- **Health Check**: Post-deployment verification at health endpoint

## Health Check
The deployment should be accessible at: http://YOUR_EC2_IP:8001/health/

## Success Criteria
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline completes without errors
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, API)
- [ ] Code quality checks pass
- [ ] Docker images build successfully  
- [ ] Deployment to EC2 succeeds
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Application is accessible externally
