# Email Service Alternatives Comparison

## Current Problem with SendGrid
- Requires domain ownership or single sender verification
- Complex setup for development
- Not ideal for testing with fake domains

## Recommended Alternatives

### 1. Gmail SMTP ⭐ (Best for Development)

**Pros:**
- No domain verification needed
- Uses your existing Gmail account
- Free and reliable
- Perfect for development/testing

**Cons:**
- Daily sending limits (500 emails/day)
- Not recommended for production

**Setup Steps:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail
2. Generate App Password (Google Account > Security > App passwords)
3. Update environment variables

**Configuration:**
```bash
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com

```

### 2. Mailgun ⭐ (Good Alternative to SendGrid)

**Pros:**

### 3. Mailtrap (Development Only)

**Pros:**

### 4. Console Backend (Django Default)
